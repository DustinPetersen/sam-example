# New Customer Onboarding Checklist

[Here, you’ll fill in the action items that your customer success team members or account managers will need to take in order to onboard a new customer. We’ve pre-populated a list of actions, but you’ll need to add, delete, or specify certain items depending upon your company’s product or service.]

# Set Up Automation for All New Customers

[]	Create an automated welcome email that triggers when a new user signs up.
[]	Schedule a follow-up email to invite your new customer to login to the software that triggers after two days of inactivity.
[]	Build a greeting message for the initial login that includes a CTA to take their first action.
[]	Design feature callouts that pop up when a user enters for the first time to help them navigate.
[]	Create content for all of your empty states (the areas within your product that don’t have content or data in them until the user adds their own).
