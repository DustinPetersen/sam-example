<h3 id="rescuetime">RescueTime</h3>
<p>Are you productive? Are you spending time on what you need to be spending time on? RescueTime keeps track of what you are doing and tells you just that with fantastic reports. Very good stuff if you’re trying to GTD and TCB. ;</p>

<h3 id="carnac">Carnac</h3>
<p>This wonderful little open source utility shows the hotkey’s you’re pressing as you press them, showing up as little overlays in the corner. I use it during coding presentations.</p>

<h3 id="trello">Trello</h3>
<p>I know quite a few people who have switched to using Notion to help document and keep track of tasks.</p>

<h3 id="windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl2">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)</h3>
<p>It really can’t be overstated how WSL/WSL2 has put the cherry on top of Windows 10. It runs on any build 20262 or higher as it was recently backported and it’s integration with Windows is fantastic. It’s also WAY faster than running a VM.</p>

<h3 id="windows-terminal">Windows Terminal</h3>
<p>Finally Windows has a modern terminal. You can run shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  Its main features include multiple tabs, panes, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, a GPU accelerated text rendering engine, and the ability to create your own themes and customize text, colors, backgrounds, and shortcuts.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/sample/windows-terminal.png" alt="" />
Look at that gorgeous terminal!</p>

<h3 id="windows-powertoys">Windows PowerToys</h3>
<p>They are back and they should be built into Windows. Install them here and get a color picker, fancy zones, file explorer addons, image resizers, keyboard manager and remapper, an Apple Spotlight-like running in the form of PowerToyrs Run, the Shortcut Guide and more!

<h3 id="vs-code---visual-studio-code">VS Code - Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>is hella fast and is my goto text and code editor. I still use notepad sometimes and I’m in full Visual Studio a lot, but VS Code is like the Tesla of code editors. Check out my Favorite VS Code Extensions below.

<h3 id="zoomit">ZoomIt</h3>
<p>A true classic but also the answer to the #1 question I’m asked. How do you draw on the screen when you’re sharing your screen? ZoomIt has been THAT TOOL in my toolbox. Really take some time and learn how to do boxes, arrows, colors and more and you’ll be a more effective screen-sharer. In fact, just go get the whole SysInternals suite and put it all in your PATH.<br />

<h3 id="7-zip">7-Zip</h3>
<p>It’s over and 7zip won. Time to get on board. The 7z format is fast becoming the compression format that choosey hardcore users choose. You’ll typically get between 2% and 10% better compression than ZIP. This app integrates into Windows Explorer nicely and opens basically EVERYTHING you could ever want to open from TARs to ISOs, from RARs to CABs.<br />

<h2 id="useful-windows-utilities-that-should-be-built-in">USEFUL WINDOWS UTILITIES THAT SHOULD BE BUILT IN</h2>

<h3 id="ear-trumpet">Ear Trumpet</h3>
<p>Fantastic advanced volume control for Windows! If you have ever wished that volume on Windows could turn their UI up to 11, Ear Trumpet is that app.</p>

<h3 id="teracopy">Teracopy</h3>
<p>While I use the excellent built in copy features of Windows 10 the most, when I want to move a LOT of files as FAST as possible, nothing beats TeraCopy, an app that does just that - move stuff fast. The queue control is excellent.</p>

<h3 id="nimbletext">NimbleText</h3>
<p>Regular Expressions are hard and I’m not very smart. NimbleText lets me do crazy stuff with large amounts of text without it hurting so much.</p>

<h3 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h3>
<p>The easy, clean, and powerful debugging proxy for checking out HTTP between here and there. It even supports sniffing SSL traffic.</p>

<h3 id="ditto-clipboard-manager">Ditto Clipboard Manager</h3>
<p>WindowsKey+V is amazing and close but Ditto keeps pushing clipboard management forward on Windows.</p>

<h3 id="taskbarx---it-literally-centers-your-taskbar-buttons-i-love-it-open-source-but-also-1-in-the-windows-store">TaskbarX - It literally centers your Taskbar buttons. I love it. Open Source but also $1 in the Windows Store.</h3>
<p>If you really want to mess with your Taskbar, try Taskbar Tweaker.</p>

<h3 id="spacesniffer">SpaceSniffer</h3>
<p>Visual way of seeing what is taking up all the space on your precious hard drive.</p>

<h3 id="fileseek-and-everything">FileSeek and Everything</h3>
<p>Search it all, instantly!
I like Win+Share+S for Screenshots but also check out ShareX, Greenshot, and Lightshot.</p>

<h3 id="vlc-player">VLC Player</h3>
<p>The best and still the best. Plays everything.</p>

<h3 id="visual-studio-code-extensions">VISUAL STUDIO CODE EXTENSIONS</h3>

<p>There’s a million great Visual Studio Extensions. The ones I like won’t be the that ones you like. But, go explore.</p>

<h3 id="gitlens">GitLens</h3>
<p>Glorious. Just makes Git and VS a joy and adds a thousand tiny lovely features that will make you smile. You’ll wonder why this isn’t built in.</p>

<h3 id="version-lens---do-you-have-the-latest-package-versions-now-you-know">Version Lens - Do you have the latest package versions? Now you know</h3>
<p>CodeSnap 
 Screenshots specifically tailored to make your code look nice.</p>

<h3 id="net-core-test-explorer">.NET Core Test Explorer</h3>
<p>Makes unit testing with .NET on VS Code so much nicer</p>

<h3 id="arduino-for-vs-code">Arduino for VS Code</h3>
<p>The Arduino extension makes it easy to develop, build, deploy and debug your Arduino sketches in Visual Studio Code! So nice.</p>

<h3 id="coverage-gutters">Coverage Gutters</h3>
<p>This amazing extension highlights what code is covered with Unit Test and what’s not. Ryan is looking for help, so go see if this is a great OSS project YOU can get 
started with!</p>

<h3 id="docker-for-vs-code">Docker for VS Code</h3>
<p>Container explorer and manager and deployer, directly from VS</p>

<h3 id="githistory">GitHistory</h3>
<p>Another nice add-on for Git that shows your Git Log</p>

<h3 id="hexdump">HexDump</h3>
<p>I need this more than I would like to admit</p>

<h3 id="liveshare">LiveShare</h3>
<p>Stop screen-sharing and start code and context sharing!</p>

<h3 id="powershell-for-vs">PowerShell for VS</h3>
<p>A great replacement for the PowerShell ISE</p>

<h3 id="remote-containers">Remote Containers</h3>
<p>This is an AMAZING EXTENSION you have to try if you have Docker but it has a horrible non-descriptive name. But must be seen to be believed. Perhaps it’s “Visual Studio Development Containers,” I’m not sure. Open a folder and attach to a development container. No installs, just you debugging Rust, Go, C#, whatever whilst installing NOTHING. Amazing.</p>

<h3 id="remote-ssh">Remote SSH</h3>
<p>Another in the VS Remote Family of Extensions, this one lets you use any remote SSH Server as your development environment.</p>

<h3 id="remote-wsl">Remote WSL</h3>
<p>Edit and debug and build code from Windows…using Linux!</p>
